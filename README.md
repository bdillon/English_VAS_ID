# Phoneme Identication Task Lab for Introduction to Experimental Psycholinguistics.

This is a PCIbex implementation of the Visual Analog Scale phoneme identification task as in: 

Apfelbaum, K. S., Kutlu, E., McMurray, B., & Kapnoula, E. C. (2022). Don't force it! Gradient speech categorization calls for continuous categorization tasks. The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 152(6), 3728-3745.

It is inspired by the English phoneme categorization task from Lab 1 in Colin Phillips' Psycholinguistics I class at the University of Maryland. The original lab is available at http://www.colinphillips.net/teaching/4237-2/3154-2/
